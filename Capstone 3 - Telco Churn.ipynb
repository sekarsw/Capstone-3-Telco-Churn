    "## Business Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In the highly competitive telecommunication industry, companies aims to maintain profitability and sustain growth by attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. With the market becoming saturated as customers are faced with numerous options, customers can easily change betwen services when they become unsatisfied with their current provider. Telecommunication companies have to optimize their products and services to keep customers satisfied and avoid high customer churn. Customer churn, the rate at which customers stop using a company's services, is a significant challenge faced by telecom providers. High churn rates can lead to substantial revenue losses and increased costs as acquiring a new customer is often more expensive than retaining an existing one. \n",
    "\n",
    "TelcoNet is a company that provides phone and internet services. The company is currently facing a substantial challenge of high customer churn rate at 27%. The company wants a data scientist in their company to create a machine learning model to identify which customers are likely to churn, allowing the company to take preventative measures to keep the customer from churning and minimize revenue loss and costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of acquiring a new customer can be as much as five times higher than retaining an existing one. Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) are typically higher than Customer Retention Costs due to the extensive marketing and advertising efforts required to attract new customers. The [average cost of acquisition](#https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-much-did-that-new-customer-cost-you/225415\n",
    ") for just one customer can be as high as $315 for a telecommunication company.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, acquiring new customers incurs higher costs compared to retaining existing customers to prevent churn. Therefore, we want to minimize the number of customers who churn \n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this model is to predict customers who are likely to churn and what factors affect their decision to churn, allowing the company to take preventative measures that minimizes revenue loss and total cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target** \n",
    "\n",
    "0 : Not Churn <br>\n",
    "1 : Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. Analytic Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analytic approach will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset exploration to understand features and data characteristics.\n",
    "- Preprocess data such as handling missing values, standardizing numerical values, and encoding categorical features.\n",
    "- Comparing several classifier models and evaluate based on the relevant metrics.\n",
    "- Impelement resampling methods in the case of imbalanced data.\n",
    "- Adjust model with hyperparameter tuning to find the best result.\n",
    "- Choose best models based on the relevant metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e. Metric Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type I Error (False Positive)** \n",
    "\n",
    "Customer is predicted to churn, but in reality doesn't churn\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost: \n",
    "- Redundant retention cost for customers who remain loyal to the company\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type II Error (False Negative)** \n",
    "\n",
    "Customer is predicted to not churn, but actually churns\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost: \n",
    "- Revenue loss from churned customers.\n",
    "- Additional expenditure in acquisition cost to replace churned customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**False Negatives** will be more costly to the business as not only is there revenue loss, but the business also incurs high acquisition costs to replace churned customers. To account for unnecessary retention costs due to **False Positives**, our primary metric will be ***F2 Score*** which balances between Precision and Recall, but give more emphasis to Recall. ***Recall*** and ***ROC AUC*** score are two additional metrics that we'll consider for our model performance.\n"

The top 3 models based on the standard deviation have stable score across the different sets.

For categorical columns, it shows 0 (the feature is not true) and 1 (the feature is true). If two similar features have the value of 0, it means the remaining column is the one that is impactful."

    "- The best model is the Gradient Boosting Classifier using Instance Hardness Threshold undersampling method.\n",
    "- As our data is imbalanced, our primary metric is the F2 score that balances between recall and precision, with an emphasis on recall. The F2 score of our model is 76 so our model can minimize the False Negatives while also minimizing the False Positives, leading to reduced CAC and CRC.\n",
    "- The model has a high recall score of 94, meaning it is able to minimize the number of customers who actually churn incorrectly predicted as not churning. This minimize the revenue loss and acquisition cost to replace these customers.\n",
    "- From our feature importance, SHAP, and LIME analysis the top contributing features are `Contract_Two Year` `tenure` and `InternetService_fiber optic`.\n",
    "- Customers with short tenures are more likely to churn compared to those with longer tenures.\n",
    "- Both low values (0) in `Contract_Two Year` and `Contract_One Year` largely impact the model predictions, meaning that customers with **Month-to-Month** contract are the ones that are likely to churn.\n",
    "- With machine learning, we can reduce the total cost up to **73%**\n",

    "    Total Cost **Before** ML: $140,340\n",
